I used the fibonacci sequence (fibo) as an example for recursion and dynamic
recursion. The function named fibo uses dumb recursion while the function
named fiboD uses dynamic recursion.

The same program is written in C, C++, Python. Python is the most readable,
C++ is the fastest, and C take up the least hard drive space.
